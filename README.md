**A Clojure library with higher level CSV parsing/processing functionality.**

The two most popular CSV parsing libraries for Clojure presently - `clojure/data.csv` and `clojure-csv` -
concern themselves only with the _syntax_ of CSV;
They take CSV text, transform it into a collection of vectors of string values, and that's it.
Semantic CSV takes the next step by giving you tools for addressing the _semantics_ of your data, helping
you put it in a form that better reflects what it represents.

## Features

* Absorb header row as a vector of column names, and return remaining rows as maps of `column-name -> row-val`
* Write from a collection of maps, given a header
* Apply casting/formatting functions by column name, while reading or writing
* Remove commented out lines (by default, those starting with `#`)
* Compatible with any CSV parsing library returning/writing a sequence of row vectors
* (SOON) A "sniffer" that reads in N lines, and uses them to guess column types

## Structure

Semantic CSV is structured around a number of composable processing functions for transforming data as it
comes out of or goes into a CSV file.
This leaves room for you to use whatever parsing/formatting tools you like, reflecting a nice decoupling
of grammar and semantics.
However, a couple of convenience functions are also provided which wrap these individual steps
in an opinionated but customizable manner, helping you move quickly while prototyping or working at the
REPL.


## Installation

Assuming you're using Leiningen, just add the following to your dependencies:

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/semantic-csv/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/semantic-csv)

If you'd like to try the latest version (perhaps useful while things are changing frequently), you may want to try using [`lein-git-deps`](https://github.com/tobyhede/lein-git-deps).
You can do this by adding the following to your `project.clj`:

    :plugins [[lein-git-deps "0.0.1-SNAPSHOT"]]
    :git-dependencies [["https://github.com/metasoarous/semantic-csv.git"]]
    :source-paths ["src/<yuourproject>", ".lein-git-deps/semantic-csv/src/"]

Then run `lein git-deps` and you should be good to go.

## Usage

Please see [metasoarous.github.io/semantic-csv](http://metasoarous.github.io/semantic-csv) for complete documentation.

Semantic CSV _emphasizes_ a number of individual processing functions which can operate on the output of a syntactic csv parser such as `clojure.data.csv` or `clojure-csv`.
This reflects a nice decoupling of grammar and semantics, in an effort to make this library as composable and interoperable as possible.

```clojure
=> (require '[clojure.java.io :as io]
            '[clojure-csv.core :as csv]
            '[semantic-csv.core :as sc :refer :all])
=> (with-open [in-file (io/reader "test/test.csv")]
     (->>
       (csv/parse-csv in-file)
       remove-comments
       mappify
       (cast-with {:this ->int})
       doall))

({:this 1, :that "2", :more "stuff"}
 {:this 2, :that "3", :more "other yeah"})
```

However, some opinionated, but configurable convenience functions are also provided.

```clojure
(with-open [in-file (io/reader "test/test.csv")]
  (doall
    (process (parse-csv in-file))))
```
And for the truly irreverent... (who don't need _computer_ laziness):

```clojure
(slurp-and-process "test/test.csv")
```
### Writing CSV data

As with the input processing functions, the writer processing functions come in modular peices you can use as you see fit.
This time let's use `clojure/data.csv`:

```clojure
(require '[clojure.data.csv :as cd-csv])

(def data [{:this 1, :that "2", :more "stuff"}
           {:this 2, :that "3", :more "other yeah"}])

(with-open [out-file (io/writer "test.csv")]
  (->> data
       (cast-with {:this #(-> % float str)})
       vectorize
       (cd-csv/write-csv out-file)))
```

And again, as with the input processing functions, here we also provide a quick and dirty, opinionated convenience function for automating some of this:

```clojure
(spit-csv "test2.csv"
          {:cast-fns {:this #(-> % float str)}}
          data)
```

And there you have it.
